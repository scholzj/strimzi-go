# Strimzi Go APIs

This project contains [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io) APIs for integrating with Strimzi from Go programming language.
It lets you manage the Strimzi resources using the Kubernetes Go Client.

## Updating the APIs

The API sources are in `pkg/apis`.
The `doc.go` and `register.go` files are manually created and maintained.
The `types.go` file is generated from the Strimzi Java API classes.
And the `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` files is generated by the Kubernetes Code Generator project.

All the files in `pkg/client` are generated by the  Kubernetes Code Generator project as well.
